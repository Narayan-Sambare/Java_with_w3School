Array program for  practice?

1. Find the Largest Element in an Array
2. Find the Smallest Element in an Array
3. Calculate the Sum and Average of Elements
4. Search for an Element in an Array
5. Reverse an Array
6. Copy One Array into Another
7. Sort an Array (Ascending Order)
8. Count Even and Odd Numbers in an Array
9. Merge Two Arrays
10. Remove Duplicate Elements from Array

Intermediate program using array
1. intermediate program using array with two pointer approach and sliding window
2. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
   Approach: Two Pointers (slow/fast)
   Example: arr = [1,1,2,2,3] → [1,2,3]

3. Move All Zeros to End
Approach: Two Pointers
Example: arr = [0,1,0,3,12] → [1,3,12,0,0]

4. Merge Two Sorted Arrays (In-place)
Approach: Two Pointers from end
Example: arr1 = [1,3,5,0,0,0], arr2 = [2,4,6] → [1,2,3,4,5,6]

5. Reverse an Array In-place

Approach: Two Pointers from both ends
Example: arr = [1,2,3,4,5] → [5,4,3,2,1]

6. Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K

Approach: Sliding Window
Example: arr = [1,4,2,10,2,3,1,0,20], k = 4 → 24


7. First Negative Number in Every Window of Size K

Approach: Sliding Window with queue
Example: arr = [12, -1, -7, 8, -15, 30, 16, 28], k = 3


8. Longest Subarray with Sum ≤ K

Approach: Sliding Window
Example: arr = [1,2,1,0,1,1,0], k = 4 → Length: 5


9. Count Subarrays of Size K with Avg ≥ Target

Approach: Sliding Window
Example: arr = [2,1,3,4,1,2], k = 3, avg = 2 → Count: 2

10. Minimum Size Subarray with Sum ≥ Target

Approach: Sliding Window
Example: arr = [2,3,1,2,4,3], target = 7 → Length: 2 ([4,3])
